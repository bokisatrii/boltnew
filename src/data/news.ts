    excerpt: 'The league committee has unveiled an exciting new playoff format that will see more teams competing in the postseason tournament.',
    content: `
      <p>The BasketLiga committee has announced a significant change to the playoff format for the 2025 season. The new system will expand the postseason tournament from 6 to 8 teams, giving more squads a chance at championship glory.</p>
      
      <p>"We believe this new format will create more excitement and give more teams a legitimate shot at the title," said Liga Commissioner Elena Petrovic. "It also rewards regular season excellence with a more favorable seeding path."</p>
      
      <p>Under the new format, the top 8 teams in the regular season standings will qualify for the playoffs. The quarterfinals and semifinals will be best-of-three series, while the championship final will remain a best-of-five contest.</p>
      
      <p>Additionally, the top two seeds will receive home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, a significant benefit that could prove decisive in tight series.</p>
      
      <p>The announcement has received positive feedback from most teams and fans, who appreciate the increased opportunity for playoff basketball.</p>
      
      <p>"This is great news for the league and the fans," said Royal Wolves captain Luka Nicolic. "More playoff games means more intense basketball and more opportunities for dramatic moments. We're all excited about it."</p>
      
      <p>The regular season is currently approaching its midway point, with Thunder Giants and Phoenix Flyers leading the standings. The new playoff format is expected to keep more teams in contention deeper into the season.</p>

    excerpt: 'In a major boost to their championship aspirations, Royal Wolves have secured the signature of international star Nikola Jovanovic.',
    content: `
      <p>Royal Wolves have pulled off a major coup by signing international basketball star Nikola Jovanovic for the remainder of the 2025 BasketLiga season. The 6'10" power forward arrives with an impressive resume, having played professionally in Spain, Greece, and most recently, Germany.</p>
      
      <p>Jovanovic, 27, is known for his versatile skillset, combining interior scoring with perimeter shooting and strong defensive presence. He represented his country at the last World Cup, averaging 14.2 points and 7.8 rebounds per game.</p>
      
      <p>"This is an exciting new chapter in my career," said Jovanovic at his introductory press conference. "Royal Wolves are a team with great ambition and fantastic supporters. I'm here to help them achieve their goals and bring a championship to this city."</p>
      
      <p>Wolves head coach Milan Petrovic couldn't hide his excitement about the new addition. "Nikola is exactly the kind of player we've been looking for. He brings size, skill, experience, and leadership to our roster. His ability to impact the game in multiple ways will make us a more complete team."</p>
      
      <p>The signing comes at a crucial time for Royal Wolves, who currently sit third in the BasketLiga standings with a 7-3 record. They've been looking to strengthen their frontcourt after starting center Ivan Markovic was sidelined with a long-term knee injury.</p>
      
      <p>Jovanovic is expected to make his debut in this weekend's highly anticipated clash against Midnight Stars. Basketball analysts believe his addition makes Royal Wolves legitimate contenders for this year's championship.</p>
